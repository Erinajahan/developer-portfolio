    <h3>Dream. Develop. Build.</h3>
    <p>I truly believe that everything that we do and everyone that we meet is put in our path for a purpose. There are no accidents; we're all teachers - if we're willing to pay attention to the lessons we learn, trust our positive instincts and not be afraid to take risks or wait for some miracle to come knocking at our door.</p>

            <h3>Become a Web Developer</h3>
            <p>Just dream big. Go for it. There's nothing holding you back. You can have ups and downs, but if you believe in something, keep the faith; keep fighting. And don't let people put you down & I am grateful to people who push boundaries, who do things differently, and who trust in miracles, dreams, and big possibilities.</p>
